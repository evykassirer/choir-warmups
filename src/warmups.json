Do the same for each leg (first the foot, then the lower half of the leg, then the whole leg). Then shake your whole body around 8 times! (If you look silly, you're doing it right.) Next do each shake again but only 4 times each. Then repeat with 2 times each. Finally (and it's pretty much impossible to do this correctly if you're going quickly enough) shake them out just once each.",

If yes, massage the neck and back, maybe leaning backwards into the person massaging them. Perhaps some music on the piano can accompany this. Fun extra: add some soft karate chops accross shoulder and backs. If the singers sing [a] it will have fun, relaxed vibrato.",

      "description": "Place both hands on the upper abdomen, thumbs touching lower ribs, little fingers near the waist, middle fingers just touching. Then release the abdominal muscles and expand the ribs to fill the lungs from the bottom up. The middle fingers should part slightly (a good sign that breathing muscles are being used correctly). The abdomen should feel firm with a small bit of give (like a firm mattress). Hold this expanded position briefly and observe how it feels. The goal is to maintain this expanded position (within reason) while saying [s] (hissing) or [v] (and ultimately, always while singing). If hissing, keep the vocal folds (muscles in your throat) open. Using the abdominal muscles and intercostal muscles (the muscles in your lungs), try to have the air flow out at a slow steady rate, all the while trying to keep the abdominal and rib area expanded (i.e. fingers still not touching), allowing collapse only at the very end (but within reason, and not causing strain).",
