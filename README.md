# Choir Warmup Collection

This project is part of a course I’ve built to learn more about choir conducting (“[Directed Study in Music](https://uwflow.com/course/music380)”, under the supervision of [Mark Vuorinen](http://www.grandphilchoir.com/about-us/our-people/mark-vuorinen/) at the University of Waterloo).


Warmups are short exercises done at the beginning of rehearsal that get a choir ready for rehearsal. As the authors of [Vocal Technique: A Guide for Conductors, Teachers, and Singers](http://www.vocaltechnique.info/) put so well, “for many amateur singers in choirs, conductors may be the only source of information about vocal technique [and] thus [have] a valuable opportunity […] to encourage great vocal technique and vocal health.” And how can this be done? One way is warm-ups, which “are critical for teaching, practicing, and improving vocal technique.”


This is why one of the biggest projects I’m working on this term will be reading several sources of vocal warmups and exercises, collecting my favourites, and putting them on the internet.

The simple version is already [live at https://evykassirer.github.io/choir-warmups/](https://evykassirer.github.io/choir-warmups/), but also have many plans for many [changes and features](https://github.com/evykassirer/choir-warmups/issues).
